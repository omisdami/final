      "voice": "Third-person, objective, and company-centric. The voice is consistent, using 'the company' or 'Hydrosight Systems Inc.' rather than first-person pronouns. Passive voice is occasionally used for formality, but active voice predominates.",
      "formality_level": "Formal",

    "formatting_preferences": {
      "heading_style": "Clear, bolded section headings (e.g., 'Executive Summary', 'Value Proposition', 'Scope of Work & Project Methodology') and numbered subheadings (e.g., '1.1 Scope of Work'). Headings are used to delineate major sections and subsections.",
      "list_usage": "Frequent use of numbered and bulleted lists to present key points, steps, or features. Lists are used for clarity and to break down complex information.",
      "emphasis_methods": "Emphasis is achieved through section headings, numbered lists, and the strategic placement of key phrases (e.g., 'Achieve Significant Water Savings'). No use of italics or bold within body text; emphasis is structural rather than typographic."
    },
    "content_characteristics": {
      "detail_level": "High; content is comprehensive, providing both high-level overviews and specific details (e.g., statistics, process steps, roles).",
      "evidence_usage": "Evidence is presented through quantitative results (e.g., 'up to 25% water savings'), references to pilot programs, and descriptions of methodologies. Supporting evidence is integrated to substantiate claims.",
      "example_integration": "Examples are embedded within explanations, often referencing real-world outcomes or pilot program results. Case-like scenarios are implied rather than explicitly detailed."

    "document_structure": {
      "section_organization": "Document is organized into clearly defined sections: Executive Summary, Value Proposition, Why Hydrosight Systems Inc., Scope of Work & Project Methodology (with sub-sections), Communication Plan and Client Interface, Project Assumptions, and Project Risks & Mitigation. Each section addresses a distinct aspect of the proposal or solution.",
      "flow_pattern": "Logical and sequential; begins with a high-level overview, moves to value and differentiation, then details the project approach, communication, assumptions, and risk management. Each section builds on the previous, guiding the reader from context to specifics.",
      "conclusion_style": "No explicit conclusion; the document ends with the final section (Project Risks & Mitigation), which serves as a practical wrap-up by addressing potential challenges and solutions."
